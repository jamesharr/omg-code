Polls
=====

Since content on github.com is web editable and they have handy rendering modes for filetypes like .csv, I propose
implementing polls by creating one CSV file per poll.

What you should do next is probably clear already.  Have fun, and post an issue or send an email if there are any
questions!



First poll: Free Software?
--------------------------
[freesoftware.csv](freesoftware.csv)

1. Are you a card carrying member of OMG!Code?
2. Are you a card carrying member of the Free Software Foundation?
3. Do you support the FSF or Free/Libre software in principle?
4. Yes or no: OMG!Code should have a formal stance on this matter (at all).
